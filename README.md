# Survival Horror / Escape Room Project

Capstone project for my bachelor's in Computer Science from Oregon State University.  
A short survival horror game developed in Unreal Engine 5. Project lead in a group of three.  
Began life as a more abstract escape room scenario, but evolved over time into a classic 90's survival horror setup.
