Capstone project for my bachelor's in Computer Science from Oregon State University; completed in eight weeks. Began life as a more abstract escape room scenario, but evolved over time into a classic 90's survival horror setup - solving various environmental puzzles to retrieve key items in order to escape a zombie-infested mansion during a thunderstorm. 

Features 9 puzzles of varying complexity, a progression-updated multi-floor map system, inventory management systems, and simple but classic combat with various zombies (four distinct models, with details such as hair, clothing, and skin appearance randomly determined on spawn). 

I was the project lead in a group of three, responsible for the overall game framework, player character locomotion (animation logic, state machines), the bulk of the interaction and inventory systems, the entirety of combat and enemies (animation logic, physical animation for hit reactions, locational blood masking of meshes when shot, ragdoll systems, and AI), as well as a few puzzle mechanics (pushable objects, combination padlock interactions). I also handled the majority of the menu systems, as well as the brief “cinematic” level sequences.
